# Going Functional: Advent of Code 2025

## What is it?
It is a list of community provided solutions for the Advent of Code 2025, primarily written in functional languages or in functional style. The objective is to have fun learning and inspire others to try the functional paradigm.

## How to contribute
- Send in a PR with links to your solutions and your GitHub username (so we can link to your profile)
- You add them to this file: https://github.com/GoingFunctional/AdventOfCode2025/blob/main/solutions.json
  - Using this scheme: https://github.com/GoingFunctional/AdventOfCode2025/blob/main/solutions.schema.json
  - In short is says that:
    - `userName` is mandatory
    - `solutions` can be an empty list (and be populated with solutions later)
    - If you add a solution, the Advent calendar day it refers to needs to be present
    - ...but links to the actual solutions are optional (so you can add them later)
    - There is also an optional field for `writeUp`s, if you want to add more context or explain your journey. Encouraged, but optional. Simplest way is to add a reference to a Markdown document in the same repository, but you can also link to a blog or something else if you want to. Up to you. Just make sure that it is a permanent resource so that it does not create dead links later.
- We will probably have some post mortems and follow ups in the GoingFunctional Slack in late Dec or Jan. See link from goingfunctional.com
- The links to the solutions will be preserved with permalinks so that you can share/embed/whatever... 
- Have fun and good luck!
